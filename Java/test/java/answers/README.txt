For the java testing,
 I created direclty UnitTests using junit (junit.org), so the test folder contains directly the unit test classes (an extra folder "answers" should be added to match the package name)

FOR
TopPhrase problem,
 I'm using Scanner to avoid problems of loading large file into memory.
 Also we may use a ChronicleMap to work with Veeeery Large Maps if regular map is not enough: http://chronicle.software/products/chronicle-map/ 

 TopPhraseTest.java in the givenInputFileThenGetTopPhrases() testcase, the path to TopPhrases.txt should be set correclty.

For SQL I don't have on-hand experience with MySQL dialect (as I used several years ago....),However I  resolved the problems but probably not in the most elegant way.
Thanks,
Cristian
